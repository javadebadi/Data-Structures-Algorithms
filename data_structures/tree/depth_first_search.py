"""
Process of guessing, trying to solve the problem, and undoing bad guesses is
called depth first search.
Looking for a goal by making guesses is called a depth first
search of a problem space.
When a dead end is found we may have to backtrack.
Backtracking involves undoing bad guesses and then trying the next guess to see if
new guess can solve the problem.
