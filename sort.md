# Sort Algorithms

**selection sort algorithm**:
- Find the element in 0 index
  - compare the value in 0 index and other indices of list, if the value in the other index was less than value in 0 index, swap those too and continue until reach end of the list
- repeat the same for index 1, 2, ...




Sort Algorithm | Time complexity
--- | ---
selection | O(n<sup>2</sup>)
