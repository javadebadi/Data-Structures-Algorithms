## Introduction
### Efficiency
Writing efficient codes is very important. Efficiency is important in **time** and **space**.    
Usually, there is a tradeoff between time and space efficiency. The faster **algorithms** usually need bigger **memory**, and using less **memory** slows down the program.

![Comparison computational complexity from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Comparison_computational_complexity.svg)Comparison computational complexity. The Figure is take from [Wikipead](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Comparison_computational_complexity.svg). The x-axis shows the number of input and the y-axis shows the computational complexity of a computation.

There are two points:    
1- As the input to an algorithm increases, the run time  of the algorithm may also increase     
2- Different algorithms may increase at different orders

### Order
The rate of increase for number of operations of an algorithm with respect to number of inputs is called **order** and denoted by **O**.

computational complexity | N | **O**(n)
--- | --- | ---
linear | n | O(n)
quadratic | n<sup>2</sup> | O(n<sup>2</sup>)

The [Big O cheatsheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) describes the order of each data structure for any operation. The same for python language is [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity).
